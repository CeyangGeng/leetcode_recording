# 909. Snakes and Ladders

- Solution

  > Generally, when the problem asks for the shortest path, the bfs will be much faster than dfs. Here is my idol Lee's solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/discuss/173378/Diagram-and-BFS
  >
  > At the very beginning, we are at the number 1.  Then we should skip to a certain position and verify the number at that position. If the number is larger than 0, we should skip to the later destination. Besides, we should use a set to record the visited positions. If the number has been visited, there is no need to keep tracking the steps of this path whose step is definitely no smaller than that of the previous path.
