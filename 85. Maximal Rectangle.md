# 85. Maximal Rectangle

- Description

  > Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input:
  > [
  >   ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  >   ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  >   ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  >   ["1","0","0","1","0"]
  > ]
  > Output: 6
  > ```

- Solution

  > Here is the key point I have extract. 
  >
  > Only pop out the higher elements from the stack.
  >
  > Leave the elements that are equal or lower than the current element.
  >
  > I came up with a strange sentence, hiahiahia: The elements that are equal with the current elements are left to be arrowed through by those elements that are lower than the current element.
