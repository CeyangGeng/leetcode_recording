# Duolingo phone interview

- questions to be asked

  1. Introduction: 

     ```
     I am an incoming graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University for 2021 spring semester, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I will graduate in May 2022. I have CPT in 2021 summer intern. I will require sponsor H1-B after graduation.
     I Interned at IQIYI Artificial Intelligence Accelerating Department for six months mainly responsible for AI web application development and AI model optimization. Web application jobs honed my skills of both back-end and front-end technology like Tornado, Django, HTML,CSS and Javascript. Model optimization experience deepened my understanding of different deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch, Keras and Tensorflow. Besides, I did many python、C、C++  application optimization using inference engine. In addition to the technology background, I am very creative and quick-thinking. The web application job is fast-paced in our department. I adapted to this rhythm of work very well and grasped the integration testing, CI/CD procedure. I can always creatively find out the most efficient way to solve problems. For example, I allocated heap memory dynamically using segregated free list which promoted throughput greatly comparing with original array based allocation. I have strong logical thinking ability reflected in my mathematics competition awards and sorting out my job logics. 
     With the technical background, creativity and quick mind, I think I am a great fit for the 2021 summer software development engineer internship.

  2. why duolingo

     ```
     First time I came to know Duolingo is when I use Duolingo to finish my English test for Duke University. The user experence of Duolingo is fantastic including the website style and question settings. Besides, when I used up the free three oportunities due to the network problem, I bought another testing oportunity. After few days, Duolingo refund that money to me. I feel very grateful because it saved me a lot of money!!
     Software engineers at Duolingo did a lot of work to improve the  application quality such as developing the complementory android app called duolingo story and the improvements to Duolingo's placements test. These works are really meaningful because it make it easy for people to learn new languages.
     Additionaly, Duolingo provides great working environment includin the language learning opportunites, company-wide hackathon and company holidays which are very attractive to me.

  3. most challenging project

     ```
     During my internship, I did a lot of challenging projects. Here I want to talk about the most recent one. Here is the thing. I optimized a model which integrates three module. The three modules function differently. The first module uses the tensorflow framework to pre-filter some unqualifies pictures. The second module use the pytorch framework and resne50 model to extract the feature map. The thid module used the keras framework. I need to optimize these three modules separately because they use different framework. Besides, at the beginning, I was not familiar with the pytorch framwork and the topologies of resnet50 model. During the conversion from the pytorch framework to the onnx framework, a lot errors happened. To solove this problem, I googles a lot of related material, raise questions on the stack overflow forum and read the source code of the resnet50 model. So after these efforts, I successfully tackled the problem all by myself. After solving this problem, I got a great sense of achievement.

- question to ask

  1. How many rounds of interviews will take place before admission?

  2. Does this time count as one of the bluh interview? 

  3. If I am fortunate enough to have the second interview, how soon will I get the notification?

  4. When I applied for the software engineer intern, I didn't see very specific requirements on the application website like the front-end, back-end or android app development. I 'm wondering what will I do if I am fortunate enough to be admitted?

  5. Last time, you sent me the intern blog which is filled with posts from the past interns.

  6. What's the most attracting point of Duolingo?

  7. What do you think of performance in this phone interview?
