# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

- Description

  > Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
  >
  > **Example:**
  > Given a binary tree
  >
  > ```
  >           1
  >          / \
  >         2   3
  >        / \     
  >       4   5    
  > ```
  >
  > 
  >
  > Return **3**, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
  >
  > **Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

- Solution

  > This is a typical condition when we need a helper function. Although the parameters are the same, the return value and the value that help to proceed are not the same.

  > ```python
  > # Definition for a binary tree node.
  > # class TreeNode:
  > #     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
  > #         self.val = val
  > #         self.left = left
  > #         self.right = right
  > class Solution:
  >     def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
  >         self.res = 0
  >         if not root: return self.res
  >         self.helper(root)
  >         return self.res
  >     def helper(self, node):
  >         if not node:
  >             return 0
  >         left_d = self.helper(node.left)
  >         right_d = self.helper(node.right)
  >         self.res = max(self.res, left_d + right_d)
  >         return 1 + max(left_d, right_d)
  > ```
