- Description

  > Given a binary tree, return the *vertical order* traversal of its nodes values.
  >
  > For each node at position `(X, Y)`, its left and right children respectively will be at positions `(X-1, Y-1)` and `(X+1, Y-1)`.
  >
  > Running a vertical line from `X = -infinity` to `X = +infinity`, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing `Y` coordinates).
  >
  > If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.
  >
  > Return an list of non-empty reports in order of `X` coordinate. Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

  >
  > ```
  > Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
  > Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
  > Explanation: 
  > Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
  > Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
  > The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
  > The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
  > The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > **![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/31/tree2.png)**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
  > Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
  > Explanation: 
  > The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
  > However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. The tree will have between 1 and `1000` nodes.
  > 2. Each node's value will be between `0` and `1000`.

- Solution

  > Take the x as the first sort index and y as the second sort index. Here we use the x as the key of the dictionary, the tuple of y and value of the node as the dictionary value.

  >     def helper(self, x, y, node):
  >         if not node: return
  >         self.dic[x].append((y, node.val))
  >         self.helper(x - 1, y + 1, node.left)
  >         self.helper(x + 1, y + 1, node.right)
  >         
  >         
  >     def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
  >         self.dic = defaultdict(list)
  >         self.helper(0, 0, root)
  >         res = []
  >         for x in sorted(self.dic.keys()):
  >             temp = []
  >             for n in sorted(self.dic[x]):
  >                 temp.append(n[1])
  >             res.append(temp)
  >         return res
