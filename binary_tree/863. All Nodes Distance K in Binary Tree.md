 # 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

- Question

  > We are given a binary tree (with root node `root`), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.
  >
  > Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node. The answer can be returned in any order.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
  > 
  > Output: [7,4,1]
  > 
  > Explanation: 
  > The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
  > have values 7, 4, and 1.
  > 
  > 
  > 
  > Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
  > The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.

  > 1. The given tree is non-empty.
  > 2. Each node in the tree has unique values `0 <= node.val <= 500`.
  > 3. The `target` node is a node in the tree.
  > 4. `0 <= K <= 1000`.

- Solution

  > Use dfs to record all the connected node value and use bfs to find the nodes that are k levels from the target node.
