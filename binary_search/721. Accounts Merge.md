# 721. Accounts Merge

- Description

  > Given a list `accounts`, each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a *name*, and the rest of the elements are *emails* representing emails of the account.
  >
  > Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
  >
  > After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: 
  > accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
  > Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
  > Explanation: 
  > The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
  > The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
  > We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
  > ['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
  > ```

  > **Note:**
  >
  > The length of `accounts` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  >
  > The length of `accounts[i]` will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
  >
  > The length of `accounts[i][j]` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.

- Solution

  > dfs: always connect the index that the email later exists with the first index that the email exists. The dfs function returns all the connected indexes.
  >
  > Construct the graph first according to the email position and then traverse all the connected indexes.

  >     def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
  >         graph = defaultdict(list)
  >         d = dict()
  >         for i, account in enumerate(accounts):
  >             for email in account[1:]:
  >                 if email in d:
  >                     graph[d[email]].append(i)
  >                     graph[i].append(d[email])
  >                 else:
  >                     d[email] = i
  >         seen = set()
  >         def dfs(i):
  >             temp = {i}
  >             seen.add(i)
  >             for j in graph[i]:
  >                 if j not in seen:
  >                     temp |= dfs(j)
  >             return temp
  >         res = []
  >         for i, account in enumerate(accounts):
  >             if i in seen: continue
  >             res.append([account[0]] + sorted(set([email for j in dfs(i) for email in accounts[j][1:]])))
  >         return res
  > ```

  > 2. union find
  >
  > Similar as the dfs. The difference is that the dfs has no need to find the root, we can start any one node in a connected graph. The union find use the root index as the key, all the connected emails are the values. When enumerating the accounts, we should find the root of the index, add the emails in the accounts[index] to the dict[root of the index]. It is more clear.
