# 63. Unique Paths II

- Description

  > A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
  >
  > The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
  >
  > Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

  >
  > An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.
  >
  > **Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input:
  > [
  >   [0,0,0],
  >   [0,1,0],
  >   [0,0,0]
  > ]
  > Output: 2
  > Explanation:
  > There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
  > There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
  > 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
  > 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
  > ```

- Solution

  > 1. Dynamic programming
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
  >            m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
  >            dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
  >            for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
  >                if obstacleGrid[m - 1][j] == 1: break
  >                dp[m - 1][j] = 1
  >            for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
  >                if obstacleGrid[i][n - 1] == 1: break
  >                dp[i][n - 1] = 1
  >            for i in range(m - 2, -1, -1):
  >                for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
  >                    if not obstacleGrid[i][j]:
  >                        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j + 1]
  >            return dp[0][0]
  >    ```

  >            if i < m - 1: temp += self.helper(i + 1, j, m, n, grid, memo)
  >            if j < n - 1: temp += self.helper(i, j + 1, m, n, grid, memo)
  >            memo[(i, j)] = temp
  >            return temp
  >    ```
