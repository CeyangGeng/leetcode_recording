# 133. Clone Graph

- Description

  > Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.
  >
  > Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.
  >
  > Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
  >
  > ```
  > class Node {
  >     public int val;
  >     public List<Node> neighbors;
  > }
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Test case format:**
  >
  > For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
  >
  > **Adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
  >
  > The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

  > **Example 1:**

  > ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)
  >
  > ```
  > Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
  > Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
  > Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
  > 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
  > 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
  > 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
  > 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)
  >
  > ```
  > Input: adjList = [[]]
  > Output: [[]]
  > Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: adjList = []
  > Output: []
  > Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 4:**
  >
  > ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)
  >
  > ```
  > Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
  > Output: [[2],[1]]
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Constraints:**
  >
  > - `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
  > - `Node.val` is unique for each node.
  > - Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
  > - There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
  > - The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

- Solution

  >   To traverse all the nodes, we can use dfs or bfs. The key point is not to trapped into the infinite loop. To avoid repeat search, we can keep a visit dictionary. The key is the node in the original graph, the value is the copied node.
