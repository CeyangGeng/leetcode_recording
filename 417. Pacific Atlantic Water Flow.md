# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

- Description

  > Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom edges.
  >
  > Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.
  >
  > Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean.
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter.
  > 2. Both *m* and *n* are less than 150.

- Solution

  > This problem reminds me of the importance of reverse thinking! If we think this problem according to the statement of it, the logic will be very confusing. However, if we reverse the thinking process, which means flood from the ocean to the cell, it will be much easier and clearer. 
  >
  > Only mark those true cells as visited !!!  This is because if a cell is not higher than the current good cell, it might higher than other good cells. This is very flexible! If a cell can be verified  from any one of its neighbors, we could mark it as visited. It really depends on the problem, pay attention to this flexible point!
