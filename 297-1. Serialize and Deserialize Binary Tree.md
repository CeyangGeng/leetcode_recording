# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

- Question

  > Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
  >
  > Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
  >
  > **Example:** 
  >
  > ```
  > You may serialize the following tree:
  > 
  >     1
  >    / \
  >   2   3
  >      / \
  >     4   5
  > 
  > as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
  > ```
  >
  > **Clarification:** The above format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
  >
  > **Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

- Solution

  > The serialization order should be the same with the deserialization order. Another key point is turn the NULL node into '#'ã€‚ This character help us to recognize the NULL node. When meet with the NULL node, we can simply return and do not need to recursive continuously.
