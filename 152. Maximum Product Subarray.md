# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

- Description

  > Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [2,3,-2,4]
  > Output: 6
  > Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: [-2,0,-1]
  > Output: 0
  > Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
  > ```

- Solution

  > 1. Every time we see a problem related with the sum or the product of a consecutive sub array, we can use the thinking entry point of using current element as the end of the sub array.

  >            temp, res = [nums[0], nums[0]], nums[0]
  >            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
  >                first = max(nums[i], nums[i] * temp[0], nums[i] * temp[1])
  >                second = min(nums[i], nums[i] * temp[0], nums[i] * temp[1])
  >                res = max(res, first)
  >                temp = [first, second]
  >            return res
  >    ```

  > 2. We can make the 1 solution more specific. If the current element is positive, then we should compare the current element multiplied by the larger previous product whether it is positive with the current number itself. If the current number is negative, we should compare the current number multiplied by the smaller previous product whether it is negative with the current element itself.
