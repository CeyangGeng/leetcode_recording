# 127. Word Ladder

- Description

  > Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:
  >
  > 1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
  > 2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
  > - All words have the same length.
  > - All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
  > - You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
  > - You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input:
  > beginWord = "hit",
  > endWord = "cog",
  > wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
  > 
  > Output: 5
  > 
  > Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
  > return its length 5.

  > ```python
  > Input:
  > beginWord = "hit"
  > endWord = "cog"

- Solution: the preprocessing method is really impressive!!! Here is my reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/discuss/40723/Simple-to-understand-Python-solution-using-list-preprocessing-and-BFS-beats-95

  To find the neighbor words, we could replace one of the alpha into '_', and make this new word as the key and the origin word as the value.  Because we use the bfs, the first time we meet the end word, we could return the transition steps.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
          def construct_dict(word_list):
              dic = collections.defaultdict(list)
              for word in word_list:
                  for i in range(len(word)):
                      s = word[:i] + '_' + word[i + 1:]
                      dic[s].append(word)
              return dic
          def dfs(begin, end, dic):
              queue = collections.deque()
              queue.append((begin, 1))
              visited = set()
              visited.add(begin)
              while queue:
                  word, step = queue.popleft()
                  if word == end: return step
                  for i in range(len(word)):
                      temp = word[:i] + '_' + word[i + 1:]
                      neighbors = dic.get(temp)
                      if not neighbors: continue
                      for w in neighbors:
                          if w not in visited:
                              visited.add(w)
                              queue.append((w, step + 1))
              return 0
          word_dic = construct_dict(wordList)
          return dfs(beginWord, endWord, word_dic)
                      
                  
          
  ```

- Solution

  > BFS: use the end word of the path as the keys of the dictionary. The values are the path ending with the endWord.

  >         from collections import defaultdict

  >         layer = defaultdict(list)
  >         layer[beginWord] = [[beginWord]]

  >                         new_word = ch[:i] + replace + ch[i + 1:]
  >                         if new_word in wordList:
  >                             new_layer[new_word] += [temp + [new_word] for temp in layer[ch]]
  >             wordList -= set(new_layer.keys())
  >             layer = new_layer
  >         return res
  > ```

- The reason why I put these two questions together is that I want to point out the difference of the two solutions. Another ugly draft drawing.
