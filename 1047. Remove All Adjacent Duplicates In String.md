# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

- Description

  > Given a string `S` of lowercase letters, a *duplicate removal* consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
  >
  > We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
  >
  > Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed the answer is unique.
  >

  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "abbaca"
  > Output: "ca"
  > Explanation: 
  > For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

  > 1. `1 <= S.length <= 20000`
  > 2. `S` consists only of English lowercase letters.

- Solution

  > 1. stack
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def removeDuplicates(self, S: str) -> str:
  >            stack = []
  >            for s in S:
  >                if stack and s == stack[-1]:
  >                    stack.pop()
  >                else:
  >                    stack.append(s)
  >            return ''.join(stack)
  >    ```

  > 2. two pointers: Using i to imitate the top of the stack. If i == -1, it means that the stack is empty. When the stack is empty or the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is different from the element at index j, we could put the element at the index j into the stack. When the stack is not empty and element at index j (**j > 0**) is same as the top element of the stack, we should pop out the top element which means decrease the index i by 1.
