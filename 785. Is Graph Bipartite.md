# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

- Description

  > Given an undirected `graph`, return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.
  >
  > Recall that a graph is *bipartite* if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.
  >
  > The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of indexes `j` for which the edge between nodes `i` and `j` exists. Each node is an integer between `0` and `graph.length - 1`. There are no self edges or parallel edges: `graph[i]` does not contain `i`, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

  > ```
  > Example 1:
  > Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
  > Output: true
  > Explanation: 
  > The graph looks like this:
  > 0----1
  > |    |
  > |    |
  > 3----2
  > We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
  > Example 2:
  > Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
  > Output: false
  > Explanation: 
  > The graph looks like this:
  > 0----1
  > | \  |
  > |  \ |
  > 3----2
  > We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.

  > **Note:**

  > - `graph` will have length in range `[1, 100]`.
  > - `graph[i]` will contain integers in range `[0, graph.length - 1]`.
  > - `graph[i]` will not contain `i` or duplicate values.
  > - The graph is undirected: if any element `j` is in `graph[i]`, then `i` will be in `graph[j]`.

- Solution

  > The basic idea is guarantee the adjacent nodes can not be in the same group. We can use color to mark this two groups. In this way, the nodes located at the two ends of an edge can not be colored into same color.  We can use 0 to represents the node to be colored,  1 represents the red color and -1 represents the blue color. 
  >
  > When the color is 0, we can color this node with the due color.
  >
  > When the color is not 0, we should compare the origin color with the color to be colored. If they are different, it means that there is an edge the two end node of which has been colored into the same color and we should return False.

  >
  > There are two kinds of return condition: the first one is we have traverse all the next_nodes in graph[node], the other one is we meets with a node with a non-zero color, we only have to compare the origin color with the color to be colored. If they are the same, then the next nodes must be the same, vice versa.
