#   222. Count Complete Tree Nodes



- Description

  > Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > **Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):**
  > In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

  > **Example:**

  > Input: 
  >     1
  >    / \
  >   2   3
  >  / \  /
  > 4  5 6

  > Output: 6

- Solution

  1. The key point is calculate the number of the nodes according to the height of the tree. If we use the branch (or the path) as the height, then the number of the nodes of this tree is 2 ** (height + 1) - 1; if we use the level as the height, the nodes of this tree is 2 ** level - 1.

     The basic idea of this question is compare the height of the whole tree with the height of the subtree. Let's say the height of the tree is h, then the height of the left subtree must be h - 1. Here comes the classify rules. If the height of the right subtree is also h - 1, then left subtree is a complete binary tree. Based on the above formula, the number of the nodes of the left subtree and the root is 2 ** (h - 1 + 1) - 1 + 1=1 << h(h is the path height). Else the right tree is a complete binary tree with the height of h - 2. The number of the nodes of the right subtree and the root is 2 ** (h - 2 + 1) - 1 + 1 = 1 << (h - 1). The number of the left nodes can be computed recursively.  Here are the recursive version and the iterative version. In the iterative version, we don't have to calculate the h of the maxheight just use h - 1. Here is the reference. https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/discuss/61958/Concise-Java-solutions-O(log(n)2)

     In each recursive or iterative, we have to compute the height of the left subtree and right subtree and repeat this for log(n) time complexity. So the time complexity is O(log(N) ^2)

  >         return 1 + self.height(root.left)
  >     def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
  >         h = self.height(root)
  >         if h < 0: return 0
  >         hr = self.height(root.right)
  >         if hr == h - 1: return (1 << h) + self.countNodes(root.right)## the first time I didn't add the parentheses, the number of the move includes the self.##.
  >         else:           return (1 << h - 1) + self.countNodes(root.left)

  >         return 1 + self.height(root.left)
  >     def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
  >         h, count = self.height(root), 0
  >         while root:
  >             if self.height(root.right) == h - 1:
  >                 count += 1 << h
  >                 root = root.right
  >             else:
  >                 count += 1 << h - 1
  >                 root = root.left
  >             h -= 1 ## a smart update
  >         return count
  > ```

  2.  Another brilliant solution:  find the height of the left-most branch and the right-most branch. If the left-most node is None when the right-most node is None, then we can make sure that the whole tree is full. Simply apply the node number-computing formula. Or otherwise, we have to recursive on the left subtree and the right subtree. Ps: this solution use the level as the tree not the path. Same reference as above.
