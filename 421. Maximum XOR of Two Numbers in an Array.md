# 421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array

- Description

  > Given a **non-empty** array of numbers, a0, a1, a2, … , an-1, where 0 ≤ ai < 231.
  >
  > Find the maximum result of ai XOR aj, where 0 ≤ *i*, *j* < *n*.
  >
  > Could you do this in O(*n*) runtime?
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
  > 
  > Output: 28
  > 
  > Explanation: The maximum result is 5 ^ 25 = 28.
  > ```

- Solution

  > Try to find out if we could set every bit from high to low.
  >
  > The perfect case is that all the bit are set. 
  >
  > We could presume the next maximum number based on the current maximum number by adding one more set bit. The variable temp represents the next maximum number we assume. Here is a rule: if a ^ b = c, -> a ^ b ^ b = c ^ b -> a  = c ^ b. We could use the sentence, if temp ^ pre in prefix, to verify if we could confirm this presume next maximum number.
