#  297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

- Description

  > Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
  >
  > Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
  >
  > ```
  > You may serialize the following tree:
  > 
  >     1
  >    / \
  >   2   3
  >      / \
  >     4   5
  > 
  > as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
  > ```
  >
  > **Clarification:** The above format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
  >
  > **Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

- Solution

  > ```python3
  > # You can use any traversal order you like as long as you can deserialize the string that you have serialized to its original state. The usage of iter() and next is very impressive or otherwise you have to use the global variable to mark the index of the character in the string.
