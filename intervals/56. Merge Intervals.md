# 56. Merge Intervals

- Question

  > Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  > Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  > Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
  > Output: [[1,5]]
  > Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

  > - `intervals[i][0] <= intervals[i][1]`

- Solution

  > The common solution of the interval problems is to sort. Here is my solution.
  >
  > ```python
  > class Solution:
  >     def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
  >         if not intervals: return []
  >         stack = []
  >         intervals.sort()
  >         stack.append(intervals[0])
  >         for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
  >             if intervals[i][0] <= stack[-1][1]:
  >                 stack[-1][1] = max(stack[-1][1], intervals[i][1])
  >             else:
  >                 stack.append(intervals[i])
  >         return stack
  > ```
