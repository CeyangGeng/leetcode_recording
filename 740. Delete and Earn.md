# 740. Delete and Earn

- Description

  > Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
  >
  > In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.
  >
  > You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
  > Output: 6
  > Explanation: 
  > Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
  > Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
  > Output: 9
  > Explanation: 
  > Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
  > Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
  > 9 total points are earned.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.
  > - Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.

- Solution

  > 1. This question is very similar with the house robber which requires that we can not stole the adjacent houses at the same night. Here is my code.
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
  >            if not nums: return 0
  >            from collections import Counter
  >            counter = Counter(nums)
  >            nums = list(set(nums))
  >            nums.sort()
  >            stole, not_stole, res = 0, 0, nums[0]
  >            for i in range(len(nums)):
  >                if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1:
  >                    temp = stole
  >                    stole = nums[i] * counter[nums[i]] + not_stole
  >                    not_stole = max(temp, not_stole)
  >                else:
  >                    temp = stole
  >                    stole = max(stole, not_stole) + nums[i] * counter[nums[i]]
  >                    not_stole = max(temp, not_stole)
  >                res = max(stole, not_stole)
  >            return res
  >    ```
