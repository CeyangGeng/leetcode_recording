# 71. Simplify Path

- Question

  > Given an **absolute path** for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the **canonical path**.
  >
  > In a UNIX-style file system, a period `.` refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period `..` moves the directory up a level.
  >
  > Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash `/`, and there must be only a single slash `/` between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) **must not** end with a trailing `/`. Also, the canonical path must be the **shortest** string representing the absolute path.

  > ```
  > Input: "/home/"
  > Output: "/home"
  > Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
  > ```

  > **Example 2:**

  > ```
  > Input: "/../"
  > Output: "/"
  > Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "/home//foo/"
  > Output: "/home/foo"
  > Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

- Solution

  > I call this kind of question segregation question because we should find the segregation mark. Here I choose the '/' as the mark. Whenever we meet the '/', we should deal with the previous path. After coping with the previous path, we should start the new accumulate process. 
  >
  > Another edge case is the last file name. Normally, the previous name can always be added into the stack when meet the next '/'. However, the last file name has no next file name. So we could not depend on the '/' to add the last file name as before.  Just analyze the last file name alone.
