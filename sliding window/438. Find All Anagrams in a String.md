# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

- Question

  > Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.
  >
  > Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.
  >
  > The order of output does not matter.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input:
  > s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
  > 
  > Output:
  > [0, 6]
  > 
  > Explanation:
  > The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
  > The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
  > ```

  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input:
  > s: "abab" p: "ab"
  > 
  > Output:
  > [0, 1, 2]
  > 
  > Explanation:
  > The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
  > The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
  > The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
  > ```

- Solution

  > This is a typical sliding window problem. Extend the right first, when the characters in the window meet the needs, we can shrink the window by increase the left pointer. Whenever the window does not meet the needs, we should start increase right again.

  >         left, right, match = 0, 0, 0
  >         need = Counter(p)
  >         window = dict()
  >         while right < len(s):
  >             if s[right] in need:
  >                 window[s[right]] = window.setdefault(s[right], 0) + 1
  >                 if window[s[right]] == need[s[right]]:
  >                     match += 1
  >             right += 1
  >             while match == len(need):
  >                 if right - left == len(p):
  >                     res.append(left)
  >                 if s[left] in need:
  >                     window[s[left]] -= 1;
  >                     if window[s[left]] < need[s[left]]:
  >                         match -= 1
  >                 left += 1
  >         return res
  > ```
