# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

- Question

  > On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions. Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.
  >
  > We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.
  >
  > Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`. `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.
  >
  > A function's *exclusive time* is the number of units of time spent in this function. Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.
  >
  > The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.
  >
  > Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

  > Input:
  > n = 2
  > logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
  > Output: [3, 4]
  > Explanation:
  > Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
  > Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
  > Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
  > So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

  > 1. `1 <= n <= 100`
  > 2. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
  > 3. Functions will always log when they exit.

- Solution

  > 1. We could store the segregated time interval into the res list. Whenever meet with the start, we should add the new_start - old_start into the res. Whenever meet the end, we should pop the filename from the stack and update the time interval of the popped filename.
