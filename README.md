# leetcode_recording

This is the recording of my solutions of the problems on leetcode. Most of them are referencing the solutions of others. I have posted the link of the original solution. Output is a kind of magic power which could encourage me to insist on coding.  Besides, my English is not so good, I hope to improve my written English and oral expression! Just get started and keep going!
