# 518. Coin Change 2

- Description

  > You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
  > Output: 4
  > Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
  > 5=5
  > 5=2+2+1
  > 5=2+1+1+1
  > 5=1+1+1+1+1
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
  > Output: 0
  > Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
  > Output: 1
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > You can assume that
  >
  > - 0 <= amount <= 5000
  > - 1 <= coin <= 5000
  > - the number of coins is less than 500
  > - the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

- Solution

  > 1. backtrack and time limit exceed
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
  >            res = 0
  >            def backtrack(index, amount):
  >                nonlocal res
  >                if amount < 0: return
  >                if amount == 0: res += 1
  >                for i in range(index, len(coins)):
  >                    backtrack(i, amount - coins[i])
  >            backtrack(0, amount)
  >            return res
  >    ```
  >
  > 2. backtrack + memorization: Because there are some overlapping sub-problems, so we could use memo the avoid repeating computations.

  >    Finally, I add verifying the left amount before going into another recursion.
  >
  >    The memo[(i, j)] means the number of combinations making up amount j from the index i of the list coins.

  >                    if amount - coins[i] >= 0: # The verifying I added
  >                        temp += backtrack(i, amount - coins[i], memo)
  >                memo[(index, amount)] = temp
  >                return temp
  >            memo = dict()

  > 3. Dynamic programming: dp[ i ] [ j ] represents the number of combinations to make up amount j at most use the first i elements.
  >
  >    The state transition function is as follows:
  >
  >    dp[ i ] [ j ] = dp[ i - 1] [ j ] + dp[ i ] [j - coins[i - 1]]: To make up the amount of j, we have two choices: whether use the ith element or not. If we do not use the ith element, we could make up the amount of j at most with the first i - 1 elements. If we use the ith element, we at least use the ith element for once. The left amount j - coins[i - 1] can be made up at most with the first i elements.

  >            return dp[size][amount]
  >    ```
  >
  > 4.  Noting that the current state is only related with the dp[i - 1] [j] and dp[i] [j - coins[ i - 1 ]], we could use 1-dimension array to store the results.
