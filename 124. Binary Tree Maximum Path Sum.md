# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

- Question

  > Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
  >
  > For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1,2,3]
  > 
  >        1
  >       / \
  >      2   3
  > 
  > Output: 6
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
  > 
  >    -10
  >    / \
  >   9  20
  >     /  \
  >    15   7
  > 
  > Output: 42
  > ```

- Solution

  > This is a typical condition needing helper function where there are same parameters and different return type. We find the maximum value (the sum of the sub-tree)during the recursive process and return the maximum side(left or right) to the calling program.

  > #         self.val = val
  > #         self.left = left
  > #         self.right = right
  > class Solution:
  >     def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
  >         max_path = float('-inf')
  >         def helper(node):
  >             nonlocal max_path
  >             if not node: return 0
  >             max_left = max(0, helper(node.left))
  >             max_right = max(0, helper(node.right))
  >             cur_path = node.val + max_left + max_right
  >             max_path = max(max_path, cur_path)
  >             return node.val + max(max_left, max_right)
  >         helper(root)
  >         return max_path
  >
