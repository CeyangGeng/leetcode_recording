- Solution

  > This problem is complicated at first sight. The key to this problem is that we always read the number every three digits. egï¼š123,456,789.  The maximum integer is two billion or so. We could represent the three digits with the help of helper function which cope with the base case(no more than 1000).  Another detail we should pay attention to is the space sign. we should add space between each string. Besides, when we meet zero in the main function, we should return "Zero". However, when meet the 0 at the helper function the whole number of which is not zero, so we could simply return empty string but not zero. Between the base cases, we should add the thousand, billion, million.  Here is the reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/discuss/70688/Python-Clean-Solution
