# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

- Description

  > Given a binary tree, return the *vertical order* traversal of its nodes values.
  >
  > For each node at position `(X, Y)`, its left and right children respectively will be at positions `(X-1, Y-1)` and `(X+1, Y-1)`.
  >
  > Running a vertical line from `X = -infinity` to `X = +infinity`, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing `Y` coordinates).
  >
  > If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.
  >
  > Return an list of non-empty reports in order of `X` coordinate. Every report will have a list of values of nodes.
  >

  >
  > ```
  > Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
  > Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
  > Explanation: 
  > Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
  > Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
  > The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
  > The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
  > The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > **![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/31/tree2.png)**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
  > Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
  > Explanation: 
  > The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
  > However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. The tree will have between 1 and `1000` nodes.
  > 2. Each node's value will be between `0` and `1000`.

- Solution:  reference https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/565677/Python-Using-Dictionary-Beats-98

  > The problem has three sort: x sort, y sort and value sort. Using the x as the key of dictionary and sorted(dic.keys()) to sort the x. As for the y sort and the value sort, we can use a tuple and sort to sort the y and value in one operation, just put the most weighted most element(y) at the first place of the tuple and the value at the second place of the tuple.
