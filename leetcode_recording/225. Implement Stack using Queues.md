# 225. Implement Stack using Queues

- Description

  > Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.
  >
  > - push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
  > - pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
  > - top() -- Get the top element.
  > - empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > MyStack stack = new MyStack();
  > 
  > stack.push(1);
  > stack.push(2);  
  > stack.top();   // returns 2
  > stack.pop();   // returns 2
  > stack.empty(); // returns false
  > ```
  >
  > **Notes:**
  >
  > - You must use *only* standard operations of a queue -- which means only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
  > - Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
  > - You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).

- Solution

  > 1. Every time we append an element into the deque, we should move it to the beginning by popleft the elements ahead of this element into the behind  positions of it.

# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

- Description

  > Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
  >
  > - push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
  > - pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
  > - peek() -- Get the front element.
  > - empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();
  > 
  > queue.push(1);
  > queue.push(2);  
  > queue.peek();  // returns 1
  > queue.pop();   // returns 1
  > queue.empty(); // returns false
  > ```

  > **Notes:**
  >
  > - You must use *only* standard operations of a stack -- which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
  > - Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
  > - You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

- Solution

  > There are some mistakes easy to make.
  >
  > - In the function determining whether the queue is empty, we can not just verify the stack1. At first, I thought that since all the elements in the stack2 come from the stack1, when there are elements in stack1, there must be elements in stack2. However,  when the stack1 is empty, there might be elements in stack2.
  >
  > - The transformation of those elements from stack1 to stack2 should be placed in the top function but not the push function. If we place the transformation in the push function, there might be some cases such as popping from the empty stack2 while there are elements in stack1. The most safe processing should be putting the transformation into the push function.
