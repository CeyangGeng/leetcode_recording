# 207. Course Schedule

- Description

  > There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.
  >
  > Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
  >
  > Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
  > Output: true
  > Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
  >              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
  > Output: false
  > Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
  >              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
  >              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

  > **Constraints:**
  >
  > - The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
  > - You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
  > - `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`
