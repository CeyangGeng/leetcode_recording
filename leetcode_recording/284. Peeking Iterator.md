# 284. Peeking Iterator

- Description

  > Given an Iterator class interface with methods: `next()` and `hasNext()`, design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the `peek()` operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1,2,3].
  > 
  > Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
  > Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2. 
  > You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. 
  > Calling hasNext() after that should return false.
  > ```
  >
  > **Follow up**: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

- Solution

  > 1. Intuitive version: I use a cache to store the peek elements and a variable inwhich to mark where the next element is in.
