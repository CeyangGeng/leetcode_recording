#  71. Simplify Path

- Description

  > Given an **absolute path** for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the **canonical path**.
  >
  > In a UNIX-style file system, a period `.` refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period `..` moves the directory up a level.
  >
  > Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash `/`, and there must be only a single slash `/` between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) **must not** end with a trailing `/`. Also, the canonical path must be the **shortest** string representing the absolute path.
  >

  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "/home/"
  > Output: "/home"
  > Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "/../"
  > Output: "/"
  > Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "/home//foo/"
  > Output: "/home/foo"
  > Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 4:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
  > Output: "/c"
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 5:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
  > Output: "/c"
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 6:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
  > Output: "/a/b/c"
  > ```

- Solution

  > 1. This is my first version solution. It wrongs at the case 240/254 which is `/...`  . I deal with the sign '.' one by one previously. However, it did not cope with the case when the file name is `'...'`.  Below is the wrong code.

  >                if ch == '/': 
  >                    if stack and stack[-1] == '/': continue
  >                    stack.append(ch)
  >                if ch == '.':

  >                        stack.pop()
  >                    if stack: stack.pop()
  >                if ch.isalpha():
  >                    stack.append(ch)
  >            if stack and stack[-1] == '/':
  >                stack.pop()
  >            return ''.join(stack) if stack else '/'

  > 2.  We can simply split the file name by the sign '/'. If there are two consecutive '/',  after splitting, there will be an empty string. So there will be four kinds of file name after splitting: `'.'`, `'..'`,`''`, 'noarmal file name'. Here is the code.
