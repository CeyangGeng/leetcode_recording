# 692. Top K Frequent Words

- Description

  > Given a non-empty list of words, return the *k* most frequent elements.
  >
  > Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
  > Output: ["i", "love"]
  > Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
  >     Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
  > ```
  >
  > 
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
  > Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
  > Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
  >     with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
  > ```
  >
  > 
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. You may assume *k* is always valid, 1 ≤ *k* ≤ number of unique elements.
  > 2. Input words contain only lowercase letters.
  >
  >

  > **Follow up:**
  >
  > 1. Try to solve it in *O*(*n* log *k*) time and *O*(*n*) extra space.

- Solution

  > 1. Bucket sort
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
  >            from collections import Counter
  >            import heapq
  >            bucket = [[] for _ in words]
  >            counter = Counter(words)
  >            counter = list(counter.items())
  >            for word, freq in counter:
  >                bucket[-freq].append(word)
  >            for item in bucket:
  >                item.sort()
  >            return list(itertools.chain(*bucket))[:k]
  >    ```
  >
  > 2. built-in function
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
  >            from collections import Counter
  >            counter = list(Counter(words).items())
  >            temp = sorted(counter, key = lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
  >            return [t[0] for t in temp[:k]]
  >    ```

  > 3. For the heap, here are some points I want to state:
  >
  >    To find the largest k elements without the order requirements, we could use the small heap, every time we find a larger one, we could use it to replace the top (current smallest) of the heap. With the order requirements, we should add poll function.

  >    4. Quick select: Put the more frequency and the same frequency but less alphabetic order into the left part of the pivot and sort the k elements in the end.
