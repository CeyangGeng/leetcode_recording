# 62. Unique Paths

- Description

  > A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
  >
  > The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
  >
  > How many possible unique paths are there?

  > Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: m = 3, n = 2
  > Output: 3
  > Explanation:
  > From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
  > 1. Right -> Right -> Down
  > 2. Right -> Down -> Right
  > 3. Down -> Right -> Right
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: m = 7, n = 3
  > Output: 28
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Constraints:**
  >
  > - `1 <= m, n <= 100`
  > - It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10 ^ 9`.

- Solution

  > 1. Dynamic programming
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
  >            dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
  >            for i in range(m - 2, -1, -1):
  >                for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
  >                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j + 1]
  >            return dp[0][0]
  >    ```

  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
  >            memo = dict()
  >            return self.helper(m, n, memo)
  >        def helper(self, m, n, memo):
  >            if (m, n) in memo: return memo[(m, n)]
  >            if m == 1 or n == 1: return 1
  >            temp = self.helper(m - 1, n, memo) + self.helper(m, n - 1, memo)
  >            memo[(m, n)] = temp
  >            return temp
  >    ```
