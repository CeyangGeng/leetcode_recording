#  212. Word Search II

- Description

  > Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.
  >
  > Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: 
  > board = [
  >   ['o','a','a','n'],
  >   ['e','t','a','e'],
  >   ['i','h','k','r'],
  >   ['i','f','l','v']
  > ]
  > words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
  > 
  > Output: ["eat","oath"]
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. All inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.
  > 2. The values of `words` are distinct.

- Solution: Build a trie to avoid repeat search. Turn the character into '#' only if it has been verified. Another point is the usage of defaultdict, here is the example to help figure out the usage.

  ```python
  from collections import defaultdict
  a = defaultdict(list)
  a[1] = [1,2,3]
  print(a[2]) # []
  print(a) # defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {1: [1, 2, 3], 2: []})
  print(a.get(3)) # None
  ```

  I drew a draft picture to explain the structure of the tire. Forgiving my painting.

  ```python
  class TrieNode:
      def __init__(self):
          self.children = collections.defaultdict(TrieNode)
          self.isword = False
  class Trie:
      def __init__(self):
          self.root = TrieNode()
      def insert(self, word):
          node = self.root
          for w in word:
              node = node.children[w]
          node.isword = True
      def search(self, word):
          node = self.root
          for w in word:
              node = node.children.get(w)
              if not node: return False
          return node.isword
  class Solution:
      def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
          res = []
          trie = Trie()
          root = trie.root
          for word in words:
              trie.insert(word)
          m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
          for i in range(m):
              for j in range(n):
                  self.dfs(i, j, m, n, board, res, '', root)
          return res
      def dfs(self, i, j, m, n, board, res, path, node):
          if node.isword: 
              res.append(path)
              node.isword = False
          if i < 0 or i >= m or j < 0 or j >= n: return # put the determination to avoid edge case of board = [['a']], word = ['a'] because the TrieNode of which the property of isword is after the character.
          node = node.children.get(board[i][j])
          if not node: return
          temp = board[i][j]
          board[i][j] = '#' # changing the character only after it has been verified.
          for direction in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
              x, y = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
              self.dfs(x, y, m, n, board, res, path + temp, node)
          board[i][j] = temp
  ```
