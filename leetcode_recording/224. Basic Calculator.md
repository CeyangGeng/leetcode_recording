# 224. Basic Calculator

- Description

  > Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
  >
  > The expression string may contain open `(` and closing parentheses `)`, the plus `+` or minus sign `-`, **non-negative** integers and empty spaces ``.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "1 + 1"
  > Output: 2
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
  > Output: 3
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
  > Output: 23

- Solution

  > (1)One of the most common method of stack is when meeting with the sign '(', we should put the element before it into the stack, and pop out the previous element when meeting with the sign ')'. 
  >
  > (2)A key point is as below:
  >
  > 12 + 34 + 56
  >
  > 12 + (12 + 23) + 56
  >
  > To calculate these two expressions, we should use two variable pre and cur to represent the previous sum and the current number. When figured out the sub () function, we should the previous sum of the sub () function will change into the current number which is in parallel with the 12 and 56. The sign and the pre should be popped out from the stack in order.
  >
  > (3) Another key point is to calculate the previous result when meet with a new sign because the new sign is the mark of the end of the current number.

  >                 pre += sign * cur

  # 227. Basic Calculator II
  
- Description

  > Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
  >
  > The expression string contains only **non-negative** integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and empty spaces ``. The integer division should truncate toward zero.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: "3+2*2"
  > Output: 7
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: " 3/2 "
  > Output: 1
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
  > Output: 5
  > ```
  >
  > **Note:**

  > - **Do not** use the `eval` built-in library function.

- Solution

  > Same idea as the previous one. Cope with the previous result when meet with a new sign.

  # 394. Decode String

  - Description

    > Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.
    >
    > The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the *encoded_string* inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly *k* times. Note that *k* is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
    >
    > You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.
    >
    > Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, *k*. For example, there won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.
    >
    > **Examples:**
    >
    > ```python
    > s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
    > s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
    > s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
    > ```

  - Solution

    > This question is quite similar with the previous two questions. The difference is that when calculate the sub expression without the parentheses, we could use one variable cur to represent the current string. However in the previous problem, we should use two variable cur and pre to calculate and these two variable turn into the variable pre in the end which is same as the cur variable in the current problem.

  The key points of calculator problems:

  1. Push the previous sign and sum into the stack when meet with the left parentheses.
  2. When meet with the right parentheses, we should turn the previous sum in the parentheses into the current number and pop out the previous sum and sign.
  3. When calculate the normal expression without the parentheses, we should use two variables including pre which represents the previous sum and cur which represents the current number we are on. 
  4. Calculate the previous result when meet with a new sign. For example, the expression '1 + 2 + 3'. At the beginning, we should assign 0 to the previous sum and '+' to the previous sign. When meet with the first '+' in the expression, we could calculate the '0 + 1'.
  5. When there are only '+' and '-' in the expression, we could use the variable pre to record the previous sum and return the pre as the return result. However, if there are '*' and '/' in the expression,  the combination priority comes into effect. So we should store the independent number into the stack but not accumulate into the variable pre.
  6. The most helpful point which figuring out what to put into the stack when meet with the left parentheses.
