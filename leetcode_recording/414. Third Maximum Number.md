# 414. Third Maximum Number

- Description

  > Given a **non-empty** array of integers, return the **third** maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [3, 2, 1]
  > 
  > Output: 1
  > 
  > Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
  > ```
  >
  > 
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1, 2]
  > 
  > Output: 2
  > 
  > Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
  > ```
  >
  > 
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
  > 
  > Output: 1
  > 
  > Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
  > Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
  > ```

  >         # build small heap
  >         heap = [float('-inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf')]
  >         for num in nums:
  >             if num not in heap:
  >                 if num > heap[2]: heap = [heap[1], heap[2], num]
  >                 elif num > heap[1]: heap = [heap[1], num, heap[2]]
  >                 elif num > heap[0]: heap = [num, heap[1], heap[2]]
  >         return max(heap) if float('-inf') in heap else heap[0]
  > ```
