# 213. House Robber II

- Description

  > You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
  >
  > Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [2,3,2]
  > Output: 3
  > Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
  >              because they are adjacent houses.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: [1,2,3,1]
  > Output: 4
  > Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
  >              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
  > ```

- Solution

  > ```python
  > class Solution:
  >     def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
  >         def helper(arr):
  >             stole, not_stole = 0, 0
  >             for num in arr:
  >                 temp = stole
  >                 stole = not_stole + num
  >                 not_stole = max(temp, not_stole)
  >             return max(stole, not_stole)
  >         if not nums: return 0
  >         if len(nums) == 1: return nums[0]
  >         return max(helper(nums[:-1]), helper(nums[1:]))
  > ```
