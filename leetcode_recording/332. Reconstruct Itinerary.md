# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

- Description

  > Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
  > 2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
  > 3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
  > Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
  > Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
  > Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
  >              But it is larger in lexical order.
  > ```

- Solution

  > We should add the result into the return list in reverse order in case of non-looping elements.

  > 1. recursive
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
  >            from collections import defaultdict
  >            import heapq
  >            dic = defaultdict(list)
  >            for leave, arrive in tickets:
  >                heapq.heappush(dic[leave], arrive)
  >            res = []
  >            def target(leave):
  >                while dic[leave]:
  >                    target(heapq.heappop(dic[leave]))
  >                res.append(leave)
  >            target('JFK')
  >            return res[::-1]
  >    ```
  >
  > 2. iterative
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
  >            from collections import defaultdict
  >            import heapq
  >            dic = defaultdict(list)
  >            for leave, arrive in tickets:
  >                heapq.heappush(dic[leave], arrive)
  >            res, stack = [], ['JFK']
  >            while stack:
  >                while dic[stack[-1]]:
  >                    stack.append(heapq.heappop(dic[stack[-1]]))
  >                res.append(stack.pop())
  >            return res[::-1]
  >    ```

  Here is my draft drawing of the thinking process.
