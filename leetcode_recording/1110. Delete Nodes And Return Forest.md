# 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

- Description

  > Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.
  >
  > After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).
  >
  > Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

  > Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
  > Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

  >
  > **Constraints:**
  >
  > - The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.
  > - Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.
  > - `to_delete.length <= 1000`
  > - `to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.

- Solution

  > The prerequisite of the node being pushed the result list is that the node is a root node and not be deleted. When the node value is in the to_delete array,  the children of this node will become root node.
  >
  > Another tricky part is changing the list to_delete into the set to_delete which could save the finding time.

  > class Solution:
  >     def delNodes(self, root: TreeNode, to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
  >         res, to_delete = [], set(to_delete)
  >         def helper(root, is_root):
  >             if not root: return None
  >             root_deleted = root.val in to_delete
  >             if is_root and not root_deleted: res.append(root)
  >             root.left = helper(root.left, root_deleted)
  >             root.right = helper(root.right, root_deleted)
  >             return None if root_deleted else root
  >         helper(root, True)
  >         return res

  > If the node value is not in the set to_delete, then we should determine if this node is a root node.

  > ​	a.1  If it is, then it should be added into the the result list, the final return actually means nothing to this situation. You can imagine that, if this node is a top level of the tree, the return function nothing; if this node is turned into root node after its parent being deleted, this return result actually is returned to its parent which is deleted. I think this kind of relationship is **one-way relationship** which means that the child node thinks itself to be a root node through the parameter is_parent in the helper function while its parent still thinks this 'root node' is its child. This one-way relationship affects nothing to the final result because the final result is determined by the word of the child.

  > ​	a.2  If it is not a root node, we should simply return this root to its parent.
  >
  > b. If the node value is in the set to_delete, we should determine what affect the delete will have on the node's parent and child.
  >
  >  	b.1 For its parent, we should simply return None in the final.
  >
  > ​	 b.2 For its child,  the delete makes its child become root node(Back to the one-way relationship again). We can still use the node.left and node.right, however, its child has claimed that it is a root node through the parameter is_root which comes from the parameter root_deleted.
