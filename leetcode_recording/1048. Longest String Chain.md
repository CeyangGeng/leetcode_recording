# 1048. Longest String Chain

- Description

  > Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.
  >
  > Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`. For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.
  >
  > A *word chain* is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k >= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor of `word_3`, and so on.
  >
  > Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
  > Output: 4
  > Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
  > ```

  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
  > 2. `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
  > 3. `words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.

- Solution

  > This question is very similar with the 1027.

  > My intuitive thinking was that to determine the maximum length of the chain ending with the words[j], we only need to make sure that words[i] is included in words[j] and the maximum length of the chain ending with the words[i].  Another important key is to sort the words according to the length but not the beginning alphabet, then we can only consider the former word is included the latter word.

  >         words.sort(key = len)
  >         dic = dict()
  >         res = 1
  >         for word in words:
  >             dic[word] = 1
  >         for j in range(1, len(words)):
  >             for i in range(j):
  >                 for k in range(len(words[j])):
  >                     if words[i] == words[j][:k] + words[j][k + 1:] and dic[words[i]] + 1 > dic[words[j]]:
  >                         dic[words[j]] = dic[words[i]] + 1
  >         return max(dic.values())
  > ```

  > 2. Then I realized that there is no need to consider word[i] and compare words[i] with all the possible word comes from the words[j] subtracting one alphabet. It is enough to consider all the possible word. Here is my reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/discuss/294890/C%2B%2BJavaPython-DP-Solution
