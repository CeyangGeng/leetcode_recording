# 79. Word Search

- Description

  > Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
  >
  > The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > board =
  > [
  >   ['A','B','C','E'],
  >   ['S','F','C','S'],
  >   ['A','D','E','E']
  > ]
  > 
  > Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
  > Given word = "SEE", return true.
  > Given word = "ABCB", return false.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Constraints:**
  >
  > - `board` and `word` consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
  > - `1 <= board.length <= 200`
  > - `1 <= board[i].length <= 200`
  > - `1 <= word.length <= 10^3`

- Solution: Every time I meet this question, I will make mistake about the order of  determining the final condition where we could return True and the determination of whether the element at the position of (i, j) equals to the character at the index position of the word.

  (1) If determination of whether the element at the position of (i, j) equals to the character at the index position of the word is placed at the beginning of the recursive function,  we should determine that condition first, then plus 1 to the index and determine whether index equals to the length of the word.

  (2) If we determine the validness of the character at the position (i, j) before going into the recursive function, we can be sure that the character before index has been verified. So we can put the determination of whether the index equals to the length of the word at the beginning of the recursive function. 

  It seems like that the (1) version is more neat. However, according to my running result, the (2) version ranks higher.

  #### In a word, we must verify the whole word before determining whether the index equals to the length of the word.
