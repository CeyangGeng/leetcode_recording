#  210. Course Schedule II

- Description

  > There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
  >
  > Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
  >
  > Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
  >
  > There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
  > Output: [0,1]
  > Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
  >              course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
  > Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
  > Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
  >              courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
  >              So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .

  > 1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
  > 2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

- Solution

  > 1. Topological sort(kind of like the bfs)The key elements of the topological sort is the indegrees list and the adjacent dictionary.  We should traverse all the nodes and all the edges. Firstly, we add all the nodes with zero indegree into the deque. Every time we pop out a node, we should process the successor nodes including decrease the indegrees of these nodes and put some nodes with zero indegrees into deque.

  > 2. DFS:  Before append the node into the result list, we should guarantee all the precursors have been added into the list. We could use 0 to represent the nodes that have not been visited,2 to represents the nodes are being visited and 1 to represents the nodes that have been visited. During traversing to the precursors, we should mark the nodes in the behind positions 2. If we meet with 1 during this process, we can verify that there is a circle in the prerequisites list. 
  >
  >    Another brilliant idea of this solution is that the return result of the sub-function is whether there is a circle and add elements to the res list during the sub-function. The main return result  is calculated in the sub-function but not the return result of the sub-function.
