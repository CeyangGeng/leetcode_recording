# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Sequence

- Description

  > Given an array `A` of integers, return the **length** of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `A`.
  >
  > Recall that a *subsequence* of `A` is a list `A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k]` with `0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1`, and that a sequence `B` is *arithmetic* if `B[i+1] - B[i]` are all the same value (for `0 <= i < B.length - 1`).
  >

  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [3,6,9,12]
  > Output: 4
  > Explanation: 
  > The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [9,4,7,2,10]
  > Output: 3
  > Explanation: 
  > The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
  > Output: 4
  > Explanation: 
  > The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1. `2 <= A.length <= 2000`
  > 2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`

- Solution

  > To make sure of the previous sub arithmetic array, we only need to know the end element and the difference.
  >
  > If two number(A[i], A[j]) wants to combine together to form an arithmetic sequence, all the information is that the sequence that ended with the number A[i] and the length of that sequence. So the state transition function is very clear.

  > dp[(A[j] - A[i], j)] = dp.get((A[j] - A[i], i), 1) + 1
