# 10. Regular Expression Matching

- Description

  > Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`.
  >
  > ```
  > '.' Matches any single character.
  > '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
  > ```
  >
  > The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - `s` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`.
  > - `p` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`, and characters like `.` or `*`.
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input:
  > s = "aa"
  > p = "a"
  > Output: false
  > Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 2:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input:
  > s = "aa"
  > p = "a*"
  > Output: true
  > Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 3:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input:
  > s = "ab"
  > p = ".*"
  > Output: true
  > Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 4:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input:
  > s = "aab"
  > p = "c*a*b"
  > Output: true
  > Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
  > ```
  >
  > **Example 5:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input:
  > s = "mississippi"
  > p = "mis*is*p*."
  > Output: false
  > ```

- Solution

  > The thinking process is as below:
  >
  > Think about the pattern string. If the pattern string and text string are both normal without special characters and  the first character of these two strings are the same, then we could leave the remain match to the recursive function. Here is a noting point that when the first character of the pattern string is '.', the first character of these two string are still the same. 
  >
  > Taking the special character ' * *' into consideration, it has to be considered with the previous character that is adjacent to it. For example, when the first two character of the pattern string is 'a* *', then the character could be matched for 0 time, 1 time or more. Here we only consider the 0 time and 1 time cases. For the 0 time match case,  we could pay attention only to the s[i + 2:] and p[j:] regardless of the validation of the first match. For the 1 time match case, we only match one character in the text string and do not move the i index foward which means paying attention to the first match and s[i + 1:] and p[j:].

  >             return temp
  >         memo = dict()
