# 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets

- Description

  > Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find whether it's possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Example 1:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
  > Output: True
  > Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - `1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16`.
  > - `0 < nums[i] < 10000`.

- Solution

  > 1. dfs: The logic framework of this problem is as follows.
  >
  >    **base case**: k == 1: return True
  >
  >    **recursive case**:
  >
  >    ​				**base case**: cur_sum == target, then start a new recursive which means search from the begin of the list nums.
  >
  >    ​				**recursive case**: if cur_sum < target, then we should continue to search the left nums to find good subset.

  >            target, remain = divmod(sum(nums), k)
  >            if remain: return False
  >            nums.sort()
  >            if nums[-1] > target: return False
  >            while nums[-1] == target:
  >                nums.pop()
  >                k -= 1
  >            visited = [0] * len(nums)

  >                    if self.dfs(nums, k, target, cur_sum + nums[i], cur_num + 1, i + 1, visited): return True
  >                    visited[i] = 0

  > 2. Dp: It took me five hours to figure this solution out! Here is my reference.  https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/discuss/335668/DP-with-Bit-Masking-Solution-%3A-Best-for-Interviews Although this solution is brilliant, the explanation is a little bit confusing. Now I try to make it clear. Omg, it's so hard!
  >
  >    (1) Use bit mask to represent the chosen numbers. For example, nums = [1,2,3,4], the binary number 0011 means that the third and the fourth elements are chosen.
  >
  >    (2) The length of dp is 1 << n: we should look over every subset of the list num. The final result of dp[(1<<n) - 1] comes from the result of previous subsets.
  >
  >    (3) dp[i] means the represented chosen numbers in list nums can be divided into several good subsets and one more subset the sum of which is less than or equal to  the target. If it is, we can add number to the last subset. So the dp[(1 << size) - 1] means that all the whole list num can be divided into several good subset and one more subset the sum of which is less than or equal to the target. Another guarantee is that the remain of divmod(sum(nums), k) is zero. So if the dp[(1 << size) - 1] is true, we can conclude the list num can be partitioned into k subsets of equal sum for sure.
