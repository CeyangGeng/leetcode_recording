# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

- Description

  > On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions. Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.
  >
  > We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.
  >
  > Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`. `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.
  >
  > A function's *exclusive time* is the number of units of time spent in this function. Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.
  >
  > The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.
  >
  > Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

  > Input:
  > n = 2
  > logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
  > Output: [3, 4]
  > Explanation:
  > Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
  > Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
  > Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
  > So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

  > **Note:**

  > 1. `1 <= n <= 100`
  > 2. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
  > 3. Functions will always log when they exit.

- Solution

  > 1. Using the stack to store the id and the result list to store the time interval. A very common use of stack is store the left beginning and pop it when meet with the end.

  >         stack = []
  >         res = [0] * n
  >         for log in logs:
  >             fn, typ, time = log.split(':')
  >             fn, time = int(fn), int(time)
  >             if typ == 'start':
  >                 if stack: res[stack[-1]] += time - pre_time
  >                 stack.append(fn)
  >                 pre_time = time
  >             if typ == 'end':
  >                 res[stack.pop()] += time - pre_time + 1
  >                 pre_time = time + 1
  >         return res

  > 2. Using the stack to store the begin time and the result list to record the time interval. Every time we meet with the end, we can pop out the time at the top of the stack which must be the match of the start time point.  And every time we pop out a time interval, we should add that interval to all the begin time at the stack which are the background of this time interval.
