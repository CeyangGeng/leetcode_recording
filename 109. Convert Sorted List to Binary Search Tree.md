# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

- Description

  > Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
  >
  > For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
  > 
  > One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
  > 
  >       0
  >      / \
  >    -3   9
  >    /   /
  >  -10  5
  > ```

- Solution

  > recursive
  >
  > using fast and slow pointer to find the mid of the linked list

  > ```python3
  > class Solution:
  >     def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
  >         if not head: return head
  >         if not head.next: return TreeNode(head.val)
  >         pre, fast, slow = None, head, head
  >         while fast and fast.next:
  >             pre = slow
  >             fast = fast.next.next
  >             slow = slow.next
  >         pre.next = None
  >         root = TreeNode(slow.val)
  >         root.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)
  >         root.right = self.sortedListToBST(slow.next)
  >         return root
