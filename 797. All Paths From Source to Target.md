# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

- Description

  > Given a directed, acyclic graph of `N` nodes. Find all possible paths from node `0` to node `N-1`, and return them in any order.
  >
  > The graph is given as follows: the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1. graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.
  >
  > ```
  > Example:
  > Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
  > Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
  > Explanation: The graph looks like this:
  > 0--->1
  > |    |
  > v    v
  > 2--->3
  > There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
  > ```
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range `[2, 15]`.
  > - You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.

- Solution: Through this question I figured out the backtracking and normal dfs. The dfs means that all the connected node should be appended into the path while the backtracking means more about the parallel.
