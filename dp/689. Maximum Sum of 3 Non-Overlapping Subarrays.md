# 689. Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays

- Description

  > In a given array `nums` of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.
  >
  > Each subarray will be of size `k`, and we want to maximize the sum of all `3*k` entries.
  >
  > Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.
  >
  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
  > Output: [0, 3, 5]
  > Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
  > We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
  > ```
  >
  >  
  >
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - `nums.length` will be between 1 and 20000.
  > - `nums[i]` will be between 1 and 65535.
  > - `k` will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).

- Solution

  > 1. DP
  >
  >    > I think the key point of dp is to find the repeat condition. I take the start index of the array and the number of the sub array we need to extract from this array as the two parameters.
  >    >
  >    > The repeat condition is we can meet many same conditions when we start from the index j and are going to extract exact number of sub arrays. So I take these two as parameters. The time complexity is O(N), the space complexity is O（N）
  >    >
  >    > Another optimization is that if we start at index i and the maximum index array is [j,k, l] and j is larger than i. We can assure that the(k, num) where k is between [i, j] can get the same result.
