# 688. Knight Probability in Chessboard

- Question

  > On an `N`x`N` chessboard, a knight starts at the `r`-th row and `c`-th column and attempts to make exactly `K` moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right square is `(N-1, N-1)`.
  >
  > A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

  >
  > Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
  >
  > The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `K` moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

  >

  > **Example:**
  >
  > ```python
  > Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
  > Output: 0.0625
  > Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
  > From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
  > The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
  > ```

- Solution

  > We can update the probability that arrives at point (i, j) at the k times step by step.
  >
  > Initially, we should assign all the elements of dp_1 to be 1 because the probability that we arrive at the point (i, j) at the step 0 from point (i, j) is 1.

  > Here is the dp solution.

  >     def knightProbability(self, N: int, K: int, r: int, c: int) -> float:
  >         moves = [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]
  >         self.N = N
  >         dp_1 = [[1 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
  >         for i in range(K):
  >             dp_2 = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

  >                         if self.is_valid(new_rw, new_co):
  >                             dp_2[new_rw][new_co] += dp_1[rw][co] / 8
  >             dp_1 = dp_2
  >         return dp_1[r][c]
  >     def is_valid(self, row, col):
  >         return row >= 0 and row < self.N and col >= 0 and col < self.N
