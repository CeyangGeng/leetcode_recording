- Question

  > You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

  > ```
  > Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
  > Output: 4
  > Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
  > 5=5
  > 5=2+2+1
  > 5=2+1+1+1
  > 5=1+1+1+1+1

  > **Example 2:**

  > ```
  > Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
  > Output: 0
  > Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

  > Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
  > Output: 1

  > You can assume that

  > - 0 <= amount <= 5000
  > - 1 <= coin <= 5000
  > - the number of coins is less than 500
  > - the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
