# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

- Description

  > Given a binary tree, determine if it is a *complete binary tree*.
  >
  > **Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):**
  > In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

  > **Example 1:**

  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  > Output: true
  > Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

  > **Example 2:**

  >
  > ```
  > Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
  > Output: false
  > Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
  > ```

- Solution: 

  > 1. After the non-empty element, there shouldn't be any non-empty node in the queue.
  >
  >    ```python
  >    class Solution:
  >        def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
  >            from collections import deque
  >            q = deque()
  >            if root: q.append(root)
  >            while q:
  >                node = q.popleft()
  >                if not node: break
  >                q.append(node.left)
  >                q.append(node.right)
  >            while q:
  >                if q.pop(): return False
  >            return True
  >    ```
  >
  > 2.  To end earlier, when find the first node without one child, then we should check if the nodes left in the queue have children. If have, then False.
